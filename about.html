    NH Home N' Brew is a product of Mariya and Ian's love for cooking. We truly enjoy the time that we spend together in the kitchen. Trying out new recipes, re-making
    one of our favorites, or just quickly whipping up dinner, cooking together is one of our favorite shared activities.

    We live and work on the New Hampshire seacoast with our two cats, CatCat and Rey. They also like to help us cook sometimes, usually adding in some cat fur for good measure.

    Ian also has a love for homebrewing, so we decided we couldn't start this website without including a homebrew section. Ian's goal is to share his knowledge of homebrewing with current
    homebrewers or those who are interested in starting. In their current home, the homebrewery runs out of the garage, but hopefully one day Ian can get a dedicated space that will allow 
    him to upgrade his set up.

    We hope that you enjoy our videos and blogs about cooking, brewing, and general life. We hope that by sharing some of what we love, we can encourage others to try out something new
    and excting.
